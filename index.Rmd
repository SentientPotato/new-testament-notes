# Introduction

In my opinion, to get the best understanding of what we should get out of the New Testament, there are a few things we need to get at least a halfway decent grasp on:

-   The first century political situation in the Roman Empire, especially the provinces of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria
-   Relevant aspects of first century Roman, Greek, and Jewish culture
-   Judaism as it was understood and practiced in the first century
-   The types of writing we see in the New Testament (e.g. gospel vs. epistle)
-   The original expected audience of each of the books of the New Testament (for example, the Epistle to the Colossians was originally written to a specific church in Colossae) and the purpose of the specific writing. Determining this may require us to examine authorship and dating

## First Century Politics

In the first century *BC*, the Roman state transformed from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.
Although the Roman Republic stood for centuries, leading into the first century BC, vicious infighting among powerful factions had taken hold.
Around 45 BC, Julius Caesar took power and instituted autocratic rule, though he was murdered within two years by political enemies.
His nephew Augustus killed those enemies, aided by Marc Antony.
In the aftermath, Augustus took control of Rome and Antony took Egypt.
However, Augustus suspected Antony and Egypt's queen Cleopatra wanted to take control of Rome, so he launched a very successful preemptive attack.
This victory cemented his power and he became Rome's first Emperor in 31 BC.
